  utter_faq_the_dialog_manager_tech_stack:
  - text: Our tech-stack is two-fold. I am build with rasa (www.rasa.com), which is
      an awesome open source chatbot framework. Most of our voicebots are build with
      Parloa (www.parloa.com). Parloa is a probably the best tool when it comes to
      voicebots.

  utter_faq_chatbot_consultant:
  - text: He helps companies to decide whether they should invest into “conversational
      technologies” and if so, he keeps helping while getting and implementing the
      technology.
  utter_faq_conversational_technology:
  - text: I am conversational technology. \n\n And so is the google assistant, amazon
      alexa or the voicebot who answers your calls when you ring up your utility company.
      Marcus helps with all of those.
  utter_faq_chatbot:
  - text: A chatbot is a computer that understands what you write or say and answers
      (sometimes) sensibly.
  utter_faq_chatbot_detail:
  - text: The difficulty is the following. We computers do not quite think like you
      humans do. We really, really need structure. When you humans talk, it appears
      to us pretty messy and unstructured. In order to understand what you mean, I
      need to structure what you say. Most of us do this by learning to extract from
      your utterances your intention and possible additional informations.

      payload: /ask_faq_intent
  utter_faq_intent:
  - text: Let's take the following example. You are hungry and you want me to get
      you some pizza. As you have no taste at all, you want me to get you a Pizza
      Hawaii (the one with pineapple). When you tell me "I want to order a Pizza Hawai",
      I need to understand two things, firstly, that you want to order a pizza (your
      intention) and secondly which sort of pizza you want (the entity)
  utter_faq_marcus:
  - text: Marcus is the actual human being behind The Dialog Manager.
  utter_faq_rasa:
  - text: Rasa is a quite special chatbot framework. As far as I know, it is the only
      one that uses machine learning not only in the NLU but also the dialog management.
      That way you can build significantly more complex bots with rasa. This comes,
      however, at a cost. When you plan to build a chatbot running on the rasa stack,
      you have to expect that development and testing will take a rather long time.
      Parloa is kinda the opposite approach.

  utter_faq_parloa:
  - text: Parloa is probably the most user friendly bot builder. At least if you are
      considering to deploy your bot on a voice channel. With Parloa you can go from
      an idea for a simple Amazon Alexa Skill to having it deployed within a day.

      will get back to you soon.
